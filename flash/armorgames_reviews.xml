    <reviewbody>Huge thanks for archiving all of these flash games. While I'm sure some may have problems, all that I have tested work fine with standalone flashplayer. </reviewbody>
    <reviewtitle>Great Archive</reviewtitle>

    <reviewtitle>What a Flashback</reviewtitle>
    <reviewbody>Amazing! This has some of the games I did play when bored in school. Makes me happy somebody took the time to try and archive old Flash content. Thanks!

(Sorry for the terrible pun, btw)</reviewbody>

    <reviewtitle>Fireboy and Watergirl</reviewtitle>
    <reviewbody>You forgot to add the Fireboy and Watergirl games that were on ArmorGames for a while. If you have any, add them here.</reviewbody>

    <reviewtitle>BearBarians and Swords &amp; Souls</reviewtitle>
    <reviewbody>I tried running the bearbarians-1454405b0.swf file on the Adobe Flash Player Projector Content Debugger, and it was missing some necessary data.
Here's the error I got for BearBarians:

SecurityError: Error #2028: Local-with-filesystem SWF file file:///C|/Users/Zierin/OneDrive/Documents/Adobe%20Flash%20Player/BearBarians.swf cannot access Internet URL http://agi.armorgames.com/assets/agi/ABS.swf.

The Miniclip version (https://archive.org/details/bearbariansgame) has no such problems, but it censors all instances of blood with a sickly green substance.
The Armor Games version is also available on Newgrounds (https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/611331), but as you might've guessed, not everybody has access to Newgrounds (I do, but that's beside the point).
I've also tried Swords &amp; Souls, another game that I used to play on Armor Games. Contrary to my expectations, it worked, and all it was missing was some font data (namely, Estrangelo Edessa and Finger).

TL;DR: BearBarians doesn't work.</reviewbody>

    <reviewbody>@PERCE-NEIGE, or for anyone else who needs to extract sprites from a Flash game: Use JPEXS Flash Decompiler, its free and open sourced, and is the best decompiler around.</reviewbody>
