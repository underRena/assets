  <description>All of the SWF-format Flash games I was able to archive from ArmorGames.com using WinHTTrack on more-or-less default settings and a computer generated list of URLs. ArmorGames allows access to their games just by visiting "https://armorgames.com/(a number)" so I simply used the latest game published on the site as a base and downloaded every page from 1 to that, with attached SWF file, in order.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;SWF-format Flash games and animations are a massive cornerstone of internet culture after the turn of the millenium, and it would be a shame to lose it all - this is the first part of an effort by me to get as much of it as possible.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;SWF files are provided as is; can't guarantee they'll work without some kind of futzing as certain flash games did like to lock themself to one website, although a handful of files I tried in the standalone Flash player on Windows 10 did work as expected.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This archive was taken on Boxing Day, 2017.&lt;/div&gt;</description>
